### Hi 👋 I'm Rashad

- I'm based in Los Angeles, CA 🏖 and almost exclusively work remotely
- I primarily build 👷 backend applications, services, and APIs 
  - Although I'm pretty productive working in React (and React Native)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is currently the tool I spend the most time learning
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 🐍 is currently the tool I'm most fastest and most productive with 
- As a advocate for both crypto 💵 and privacy 🕵🏽‍♂️, I wrote [xmrpy](https://github.com/aar3/xmrpy) to help developers quickly build Monero-based web applications
- Most of my professional experience has been in web/network programming
  - I'm currently most interested in systems programming
